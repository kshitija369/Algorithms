Usage:
python NaiveBayes.py â€œParent Dir containing Dir named Dataset"
python BalancedError.py "Parent Dir containing Dir named Dataset"

Note:
1. The NaiveBayes.py script runs on all the datasets listed under input folder "path/Dataset"

2. The NaiveBayes.py script outputs prediction under respective dataset folder

3. The BalancedError.py script calculates error for all the datasets listed under input folder "path/Dataset"

4. For Automation purposes, I had renamed some of the dataset names to match the internal names.
ex. climate_simulation renamed to climate
    qsar_boideg renamed to qsar.

5. These renamed dataset are also submitted with the assignment. The submission also contains a output screenshot
